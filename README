# Stock Chart Web Application

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to visualize 
stock data using Candlestick and Gap charts. The application uses the 
Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to fetch historical stock data and Plotly for 
chart visualization.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Upon accessing the root URL ("/"), users are presented 
with the homepage. This can be customized by modifying the `index()` 
function in the `app.route('/')` decorator.

- **Current Price Endpoint**: The `/get_current_price` route allows users 
to get the current price of a given stock symbol. This is achieved by 
sending an AJAX request to this endpoint with the desired stock symbol as 
a query parameter.

- **Chart Visualization**: Users can submit a form containing a stock 
symbol and optional start and end dates to visualize a Candlestick chart 
with Gap lines overlaid. The chart provides insights into the stock's 
open, high, low, and close prices, as well as gaps between consecutive 
trading days.
